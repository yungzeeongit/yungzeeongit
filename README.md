    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a very curious mind who loves learning and knowing about new things, my eyes are currently on tech and at this rate,
        it might be a long time before I take my eyes off tech. Apart from web development, i have had the opportunity to
        start learning about Linux and DevOps, it might not be much but i can confidiently find my way home from the coffee shop,
        on a linux machine ,even if i do get lost, Google and ChatGPT will rescue me. I can
        create, configure and connect multiple Virtual Machines. I am currently learning how to use Docker and i hope to update
        my readme in a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
          As a curious mind, learning how to properly document things i have learned or currently learning about has been top of my
       to-do list and big thanks to <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(107, 37, 107);" href="https://twitter.com/zaycodes">zaycodes</a>
        and their selfless and wonderful facilitators, i am in the process of achieving this goal as i am currently enrolled in the second cohort
        of WriteTech Bootcamp.
