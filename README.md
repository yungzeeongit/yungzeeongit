# Hi, I am Babatunde, a Nigerian Techie. Welcome to my profile

## About Me

I am a very curious mind who loves learning and discovering new things, with a strong focus on tech. At this rate, it might be a long time before I take my eyes off tech. Apart from web development, I've also ventured into learning about Linux and DevOps. While I might not be an expert yet, I can confidently find my way around a Linux machine, and if I ever get lost, Google and ChatGPT will rescue me. I can create, configure, and connect multiple Virtual Machines. Currently, I'm learning how to use Docker, and I hope to update my readme with more soon.

As a curious mind, learning how to properly document things I've learned or I'm currently learning has been a top priority for me. Big thanks to [zaycodes](https://twitter.com/zaycodes) and their selfless facilitators. I'm currently enrolled in the second cohort of WriteTech Bootcamp, working towards achieving this goal.
